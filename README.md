I'm the Assistant Unit Leader for Fisheries in the [U.S. Geological Survey Washington Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://depts.washington.edu/wacfwru/). I'm also an associate professor in the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu) at the University of Washington.

I am an applied ecologist who integrates different data sources and analytical methods to study a variety of problems related to the conservation and management of aquatic resources, particularly along the west coast of North America. Much of my research is focused on the development and application of statistical methods for analyzing temporal and spatial data. Examples of recent projects include integrated population models for Pacific salmon, evaluation of the risks and rewards of ecological portfolios, and assessing the effects of large-scale disturbances from natural and anthropogenic causes.
